**Biography:**

Dr Mazumdar is a computer systems and architecture researcher with an emphasis on visual computing applications, like AR/VR and video streaming. Since receiving her PhD in June 2020, she has been building Vignette Inc., a University of Washington (UW) spin-out company based on her visual computing research and funded by a CoMotion Fellowship.

Her PhD work was advised by Luis Ceze and Mark Oskin in the Allen School of Computer Science at the University of Washington. During grad school, she worked in the computer architecture group, the UW Reality Lab, and the UW DB group. She also spent time working with vision and graphics researchers at the Facebook Reality Lab and Google Research.

Her research focuses on new systems for VR, video, and graphics using hardware-software codesign and ML-for-systems techniques. My work spans the glass-to-glass visual computing pipeline; She likes to work on systems problems ranging from camera capture, to visual data processing and storage, to media distribution and rendering. In her dissertation, she proposed perceptual optimizations, a new class of domain-specific optimizations for vision and graphics workloads, to improve performance for custom hardware accelerators, storage systems, and data management systems.

Before graduate school, she studied computer engineering and English literature at Columbia University.
